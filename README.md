# fwi25-tools
A set of tools being developed to support the use of the FWI2025 release

## FWI Calculator 
This is an R Shiny app that can be used to input an hourly weather file and calculate FWI2025 outputs. It currently functions only on a pre-made hourly file. The user can set all constraints as required.
Currently works utilizing the `main` branch from the https://github.com/nrcan-cfs-fire/cffdrs-ng repo.
